      "summary": "A 1959 incident in the Ural Mountains where nine experienced Soviet hikers died under mysterious circumstances. The case baffled investigators for decades but was conclusively explained by a 2021 scientific study as a slab avalanche.",
      "full": "The Dyatlov Pass Incident is one of the most famous unsolved mysteries of the 20th century that has now been explained. In February 1959, nine experienced hikers led by Igor Dyatlov died in the northern Ural Mountains. The group's tent was found torn open from inside, and the bodies were scattered across the mountainside in various states of undress, some with severe internal injuries but no external trauma. For over 60 years, the incident spawned conspiracy theories involving everything from military tests to yetis. However, a comprehensive 2021 study published in Communications Earth & Environment conclusively demonstrated that a rare type of delayed slab avalanche, combined with the severe conditions and panic response, explains all the evidence. This case exemplifies how scientific investigation can solve even the most baffling historical mysteries."
