      "full": "The Dyatlov Pass Incident is one of the most famous mysteries of the 20th century—now conclusively solved. On the night of February 1-2, 1959, nine experienced Soviet hikers died under mysterious circumstances in the northern Ural Mountains. For over 60 years, the bizarre details spawned countless theories ranging from avalanches to military tests to paranormal phenomena. In 2021, a comprehensive scientific study published in *Communications Earth & Environment* definitively explained the tragedy: a rare delayed slab avalanche, combined with extreme cold and human panic response, accounts for all the evidence."
